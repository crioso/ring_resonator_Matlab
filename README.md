# ring_resonator_Matlab

Code to find and choose the resonance peaks out of a ring resonator spectrum and do a Lorentz fit to each peak. 

peak_finde_and_analysis.m returns the wavelength of resonance, Q-factor, FSR, Extinction Ration, losses under three different coupling criteria, and the amplitude coupling coefficient. Requires the functions in folder lib. Instructions on how to use at the top of the code file. 

ring_spectrum_example.csv -> experimental data of a ring resonator of R=120um. The default set of parameters in the file are based on this particular example.
